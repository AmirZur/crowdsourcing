Coding4LifeScience is doing a bioinformatics project on RNA sequencing of the Salmonberry plant.  
 
Why are we doing this?  
Local High School and College students have been learning bioinformatics and want the experience of a hands-on science project.  

Why Salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis)?  
In the beautiful Pacific Northwest, we have many native plants with interesting ethnobotany and medicinal uses. http://www.goodfoodworld.com/2012/12/salmonberry-food-medicine-culture/    
Salmonberries are related to raspberries, which are ancient plants, believed to have been brought to North America across the Bering Land Bridge. The blackberry is also in the Rubus genus with salmonberry and raspberry.  
Choosing salmonberry lets us ask some interesting scientific questions and make comparisons with other plants in the same genus, as well as unrelated plants that have medicinal properties. Plus we love our salmonberries!  

Why RNA sequencing? 
RNA sequencing lets us look at the transcriptome which shows the genes that are being actively expressed. The transcriptome provides insights into what proteins the cell is making and can be used to compare gene expression between different parts of the same plant and between similar plants. Knowing what proteins are being coded for and what other gene activity is occurring can give information about medicinal and nutritional properties of the plant.  


Why are we raising money? 
While we look forward to doing all the analysis, we need to pay to have the RNA sequencing done. Please follow our progress and support us on Indigogo (give link) 
For people who know us, we have a WA state nonprofit and all money goes to the project. Deposits can be made directly to our bank account (give information) We will have the same incentives with some additional options.
