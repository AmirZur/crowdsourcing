## Overview  

The salmonberry, or the Rubus spectabilis, is a member of the Rosacea family, the same family as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and many more fruits. The salmonberry shares a similar structure to blackberries and raspberries, but has a bright orange color. These berries grow almost exclusively in the West of North America, on the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.  

## Reproduction  

Salmonberries attract hummingbirds and other insects with their flowers. Birds and insects usually land on the flower and take some pollen. They then travel to another salmonberry plant where the pollen that they acquired from the first plant rubs off and pollinates the plant, initiating salmonberry reproduction.  

Salmonberries also reproduce through consumption by mammals. Each drupelet of a salmonberry has a seed, which is protected enough to withstand the digestive tract of an animal, is dropped in the hopes that it grows into a plant. Not very many seeds germinate the immediate spring, but this does not present a problem as seeds can stay dormant for decades. A triggering factor could be a low-intensity fire, causing a seed to break out of its cotyledon and start sprouting. A high-intensity fire can be detrimental and inhibit the growth of a salmonberry.  

Another category of reproductive methods salmonberries use extensively is vegetative. An example of this is the concept of rhizomes. This happens when extensive root system of a salmonberry creates buds, which then grow into flowering plants. Rhizomes can grow rapidly and a single network has the potential to grow hundreds of thousands of buds per each acre.  

Another form of reproduction is layering. This is when one of the stems is fallen by something dropping on it, causing it to make contact with the ground. When there is a bud on the fallen stem, a new plant can sprout from the single bud, and layering occurs. This is another example of interconnected salmonberry plants growing off on another.  

The last method of reproduction is basal sprouting. This is when multiple buds grow off of the base of the stem, and is particularly useful when the main aerial stems are damaged, as it can create a new set of stems for the plant to reproduce through. In a world where hunger is normal for a sixth of the global population, plant reproduction is important to study to maximize the output of food.
