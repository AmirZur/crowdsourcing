One of the many steps in our salmonberry project entails getting our samples sequenced. When sequencing samples, the exact order of nucleotides within a certain genetic molecule is determined. We will analyze those sequences using bioinformatics and relate to our understanding of the health benefit of salmonberry.
 
Inside the umbrella of “sequencing”, there are a plethora of sequencing options to choose from. To start, there is RNA sequencing and DNA sequencing. For different uses, one option can be more advantageous over the other. Regarding the salmonberry and the work we plan to do, getting insight into the functionality of the active genes themselves is a priority. Consequently, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is the better option because of its’ lower cost and the information it will give us on the genes of the salmonberry.  
 
There are various sequencing centers across the country that offer these services, so we needed to contact them to figure out what the best rates would be. We used procedure from a paper on the genome of the black raspberry: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13215/full as a guide for our rate inquiries. 
 
Duke Center for Genomics and Computational Biology has a online estimator (DUGSIM) where you can figure out the cost of several different sequencing services. Though, those prices are for services a little large for our needs.  
 
Instead, centers such as the Northwest Genomics Center at the University of Washington have systems more appropriate for our sample sizes: 100 bp (sample length) reads on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2 flow cell (type of sequencing machine). For 50 million reads per sample, the cost is $320.  
 
In the bigger scheme of things, we’ll use this estimate to plan our crowdfunding amount accordingly.
